Answer the question strictly using the retrieved context. If the context does not contain the required fact, respond with:
Summary: Unable to determine from context.

Details:
{{}}

Question: {query}

Retrieved Context:

Format the final response exactly as follows:

Summary: <single sentence that resolves the question using contract language>

Details:
{{
  "who_bears_tariff": <string or null>,
  "incoterm": <string or null>,
  "policy_citations": [<list of exact section titles or schedule references>],
  "calculations": <object mirroring field names from the contract (e.g., "tariff_delta_rate")>,
  "exposure_breakdown": <object when monetary impacts are described>,
  "rights_and_remedies": <object when remedies or cancellation rights are cited>,

}}

Rules:
- Omit keys that are not supported by the context; do not invent fields or values.
- Preserve key names, punctuation, and numeric precision exactly as they appear (e.g., "threshold_triggered_(>3%)", "price_adjustment_total_usd").
- Use double quotes for all JSON keys and string values and indent JSON with two spaces.
- Quote section and schedule references verbatim in "policy_citations".
- Never include commentary outside the required structure.
